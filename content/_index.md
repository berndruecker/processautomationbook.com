## From The Back Cover

> Weaving together ideas from microservices, event-driven systems, and Domain-Driven Design, this book describes when, why, and how to effectively leverage workflows within a modern software architecture. Taking a pragmatic practitioner's approach, it uses real-world examples and explores the pros and cons of multiple alternative patterns in detail. It should be on every architect's bookshelf.

***Randy Shoup**, VP Engineering and Chief Architect at eBay*

> Bernd has championed and delivered developer-friendly process automation tools for the best part of the last decade. Now, in this pragmatic new book, Bernd brings that wealth of experience to show how process automation models, methods, and tools can be applied to tame the complexity of microservices and cloud-native architectures which are becoming ever more prevalent in todayâ€™s technology landscape. I highly recommend this book for architects and developers who want to add process automation thinking to their design toolkit.
 
***Richard Tarling**, Digitization & Workflow Engineering Co-lead at Goldman Sachs*

> Process automation has often been viewed as the antithesis of modern, agile software development: snazzy "doodleware" demos that don't scale to real use cases, poor testability, and version control only for the fortunate ones. No one better than Bernd to show us that this perception has little to do with workflow and process automation but merely with past implementations. Seeing process automation as an extension of well-established software development methods and architectures breathes a much welcome breeze of fresh air into the field.
