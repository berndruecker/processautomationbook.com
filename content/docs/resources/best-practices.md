# Best Practices

You want to use visual models to better understand, discuss and remember processes. Hence it pays off to invest some effort in making the models easy to read and understand,
which boils down to following modeling conventions. Most enterprises define their own conventions over time. 

You can find exemplary modeling conventions online:

* [Creating readable process models](https://camunda.com/best-practices/creating-readable-process-models/)
* [Naming BPMN elements](https://camunda.com/best-practices/naming-bpmn-elements/)

Note that the [Camunda](https://camunda.com/best-practices/) also include further best practices for process automation projects using the Camunda Platform. Some of them also informed this book and might be interesting to look at even if you don't use Camunda.
