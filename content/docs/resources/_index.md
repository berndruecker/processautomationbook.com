# Additional Resources

There are so much great resources out there around process automation. My aim is not to provide a full overview - but to give you some help to do your first steps.

Please note, that such a list might miss great resources, that I am either not aware of or simply have forgotten to add in the hectic of the day. Please don't hesitate to give me [feedback](../feedback/) or open a pull request for any of these pages (click on the *edit this page* button at the bottom of a page). This way you can help to improve this website.
