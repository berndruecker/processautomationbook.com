</h1>
<p>In today&rsquo;s IT architectures, microservices and serverless functions play an increasingly important role. But how can you create meaningful, comprehensive, and connected business solutions if the individual components are decoupled and independent by design? This book provides a framework through examples and practical advice, and reveals how you can design complex processes in such an environment to deliver true business value.</p>
<p>Therefore, this book dives into a developer-friendly view on process automation and explains how process automation can be applied in modern system architectures and software development practices.</p>
<p>It focuses on lightweight workflow engines as the core component to make this happen, which should be part of every developers tool belt.</p>
<p>The book also discusses typical misconceptions around process automation and orchestration.</p>
<h1 id="why-you-should-read-this-book">
  Why You Should Read This Book
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-you-should-read-this-book">#</a>
</h1>
<ol>
<li>Digital transformation is happening everywhere and automation a must.</li>
<li>Many processes are tailor-made to an organization&rsquo;s needs, as this allows to differentiate from competition. Therefore they cannot be addresses by off-the-shelf application software.</li>
<li>Automating these processes is complex and requires software engineering, but with specific characteristics and requirements.</li>
<li>You will need a developer-friendly way to automate processes, leveraging lightweight workflow engine technology. This is exactly what this book explains to you.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="who-this-book-is-for">
  Who This Book is For
  <a class="anchor" href="#who-this-book-is-for">#</a>
</h1>
<p>This book targets software developers, software engineers and software or system architects that want to learn about process automation.</p>
<p>If you are a software developer, you might want to use a workflow engine within your application, service or microservice to solve hands-on problems. This book will help you understand which problems a workflow engines solves for you, and how you get started.</p>
<p>If you are a system architect, this book will help you understand opportunities and pitfalls around process automation. It will guide you through some tough architectural decisions and trade-offs, including how using a workflow engine compares to alternative approaches or if a workflow engine should be operated centrally or not.</p>
<p>But you can also benefit, if you work in another role:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are an IT manager, the book can also help you to make better informed decisions and ask the right questions internally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are a business analyst, this book can help you if you are motivated to think a bit out-of-the-box and understand the technical side of things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will only need some general experience in the field of software engineering, but no other specific knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Weaving together ideas from microservices, event-driven systems, and Domain-Driven Design, this book describes when, why, and how to effectively leverage workflows within a modern software architecture. Taking a pragmatic practitioner&rsquo;s approach, it uses real-world examples and explores the pros and cons of multiple alternative patterns in detail. It should be on every architect&rsquo;s bookshelf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Randy Shoup</strong>, VP Engineering and Chief Architect at eBay</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bernd has championed and delivered developer-friendly process automation tools for the best part of the last decade. Now, in this pragmatic new book, Bernd brings that wealth of experience to show how process automation models, methods, and tools can be applied to tame the complexity of microservices and cloud-native architectures which are becoming ever more prevalent in todayâ€™s technology landscape. I highly recommend this book for architects and developers who want to add process automation thinking to their design toolkit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Richard Tarling</strong>, Digitization &amp; Workflow Engineering Co-lead at Goldman Sachs</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Process automation has often been viewed as the antithesis of modern, agile software development: snazzy &ldquo;doodleware&rdquo; demos that don&rsquo;t scale to real use cases, poor testability, and version control only for the fortunate ones. No one better than Bernd to show us that this perception has little to do with workflow and process automation but merely with past implementations. Seeing process automation as an extension of well-established software development methods and architectures breathes a much welcome breeze of fresh air into the field.</p>
